        <h1>After ARIA live hidden</h1>
        <p>See the live cricket score from the sticky strip at the faar bottom side of this screen. Screen
            readers are automatically notified for the latest updated score from the
            strip below regardless of where the screen reader curser is.</p>
        <p>The score board will be updated every 10 seconds. This time, I have added ARIA live attributes into the
            hidden div that is serving for the equivalent purpose.</p>
        <p>Sometime, It become essential that same level of information needs to be given to the screen reader using
            ARIA in a nice format so a screen reader user can also understand the same level of information as a sighted
            person and they do not have to use their cognitive functions conciously to understand the information.</p>
